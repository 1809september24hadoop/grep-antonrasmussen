#1 grep '^Z' cities.txt | cat
#2 grep 'gan$' cities.txt | cat
--I've opted to use $ instead of \> because we are looking for 
--cities that end with the word gan and not for cities that might
--contain multiple words that end in gan... for example, 
--if there were a city called Foogan Bar, using \> would 
--incorrectly grab this city 
#3 grep -E '^A|^D|^E' cities.txt | cat -b
--Note, in this command and in ones below, I've added the -b to cat
--in order to show the expected output of 53 lines
#4 grep '\<.ar' cities.txt | cat -b
--Note, I had a bit of confusion with the wording of this question 
--originally but Peter was quick to reword the question for clarity.
